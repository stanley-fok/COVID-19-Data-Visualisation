# COVID-19 Data Analysis in Scotland and Globally (2020)

# Research Task: 
Analyse COVID-19 data in Scotland during 2020 to identify key trends and patterns in dates, testing, confirmed cases, and deaths and evaluate the pandemic's progression. Additionally, leveraging vaccine data to assess the impact of vaccination efforts on public health and determine how vaccination status influenced COVID-19 trends.

Summary of insights  

• Peak of the Pandemic: Both the highest active cases and deaths were recorded on 2020-07-31, indicating this was a critical point in the pandemic's timeline.

• Consistent High Levels: The small changes in active cases and deaths during the top dates indicate that the healthcare system faced continuous strain over this period.

• Increasing Trend in Active Cases: The steady rise in active cases from mid-July to the end of the month indicates a potential delay in response measures or the impact of external factors such as new variants, easing restrictions, or delayed vaccination rollouts.

• Holiday Impact: A significant drop in vaccinations was observed during the Christmas holidays, suggesting the need to plan for continuity of healthcare services during festive seasons.

• Strategic Peaks: The high vaccination numbers before and after the holidays may reflect strategic planning by health authorities to maximize coverage. Understanding such patterns can help optimize resource allocation in future vaccination campaigns.



Recommendations & Succeeding Steps

• Investigate potential external factors such as weather conditions, vaccine supply, and public sentiment to understand their influence on vaccination rates.

• Examine the impact of local or regional policies during the study period to identify correlations between governmental actions and vaccination uptake.

• Investigate Low Vaccination Days: Explore factors like holidays, weather, or supply issues contributing to dips on dates like December 25-26. Adjust operations or introduce mobile units to maintain coverage.

• Replicate Success on Peak Days: Analyze factors driving high rates on dates like December 22 and apply those strategies consistently.

• Understand External Influences: Study the impact of policies, public sentiment, and external factors (e.g., weather) to refine strategies.

• Target Underperforming Regions/Demographics: Focus outreach on underserved groups or areas, addressing barriers such as misinformation or accessibility.

• Improve Data Tracking: Enhance real-time data monitoring for better insights and quicker strategy adjustments.



# Research Task:
Analyze COVID-19 trends on a global scale by examining confirmed cases, death tolls, and recovery rates across different countries. Identify key trends and patterns in virus spread, the correlation between case severity and mortality, and recovery statistics. Additionally, explore the potential effects of government policies, vaccination rollouts, and external factors on the pandemic’s progression.

Summary of insights

• Global Impact: The US, Brazil, and India had the highest cases, while the US, Brazil, Italy, and the UK reported the most deaths, highlighting healthcare and policy differences.

• Trends & Patterns: Peak infections varied by country, and death rates didn’t always correlate with case numbers, indicating factors like healthcare quality and interventions.

• Vaccination & Recovery: High vaccination rates improved recovery and reduced severe cases over time.

• Policy & Public Response: Early lockdowns, strong healthcare systems, and public compliance significantly affected virus control.


Recommendations & Succeeding Steps

• Study how policies and vaccines influenced case trends.

• Analyse economic and healthcare disparities in recovery rates.

• Investigate external factors like climate and mobility on virus spread.

• Enhance real-time data tracking for better pandemic preparedness.
